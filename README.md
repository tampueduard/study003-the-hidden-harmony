# STUDY003 The Hidden Harmony
### a Digital Synesthetic System (2017 - 2021)

In time this has been studied with more than one theory. From Greeks with Aristotle (On Colours), to Isaac Newton (Opticks) and many other artists like Kandinsky (On the Spiritual in Art) and Skrjabin (Prometheus: The Poem of Fire). The relation between colours and sounds I developed is not based on a scientific description of these two realms, but more on my personal view on how these interract. The series of studies under The Hidden Harmony tries to augment our perception. What if it would be possible to listen to a painting or see colours while listening to music?
